         <h2>Landscape Photography</h2>
        <p>Landscape photography captures the everchanging outdoors in a piece of data that doesn't decay. It's important to me to highlight the strange and beautiful scenery our Earth provides us-- therefore, landscape photography is important to me. For anyone curious about how to take landscape photography, there is a National Geographic link below.</p>

            <h3>Photo taken at Greenway Farms, over the quarry.</h3>
 
        <p>This photo was taken in early September at Greenway Farms in Hixson. My environmental biology class took field trips a lot to this particular park for our assignments. I thoroughly enjoyed learning in nature and I'm thankful my professor was adament about us doing so.</p>
