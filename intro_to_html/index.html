    <h1>Who am I?</h1>
    
    <p>Hello! I'm Sam M. Weathers. In my free time I enjoy spending time with my family, playing guitar and singing for my punk band, skateboarding, and cooking. I work primarily in videography, photography, livestreams, and photo/video editing. I've worked in this field since I was around 12 years of age, shooting videos off of my hand-me-down Nikon, an iPhone 4, and iMovie editing software. </p>
